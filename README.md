# IsoBuster Plugins
Plugin framework for IsoBuster

There is an existing framework for IsoBuster Image File support ( https://www.isobuster.com/plugins.php ).  It was created in 2010 but nobody cared, so it got into disarray.  It needs a serious overhaul.  However, I have no intention of doing the work unless I feel there is genuine interest (concrete plans even).

Once I feel it's worth it I will do the work and post the framework here.  It's basically a dll that needs to be built in 32 bit and 64 bit versions.

So .. DO LET ME KNOW
